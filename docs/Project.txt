Project Notes
______________

1. The project took me a total of 28 hours to complete.
2. Things that I would add to the project is more unit tests. I only managed
to complete the Controller tests. I would have liked to
have added unit tests for the repositories. I would also
like to use SQL Server or PostGreSql as a database.
3. I would also like to add more API methods e.g. to create
a stadium.
