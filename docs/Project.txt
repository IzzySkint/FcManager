Project Notes
______________

1. The project took me a total of 28 hours to complete.
2. Things that I would add to the project is more unit tests. I only managed
to complete the Controller tests. I would have liked to
have added unit tests for the repositories. I would also
like to use SQL Server or PostGreSql as a database.
3. I would also like to add more API methods e.g. to create
a stadium.

To run the project you can build in the IDE you prefer then run.

The API documents for the project are available at:
https://localhost:5001/swagger/index.html

To test the client you will have to create a user, this is done
using the Account API, which is available in the swagger documentation.

The Root user has the following credentials:
User Name: john.smith@gmail.com
Password: P@ssword123

Only the Root user can create new users.

The application uses a JWT token, which must be passed in the
Authorization header if you are using Postman to test with.

To test the application you can run it and create a player:
